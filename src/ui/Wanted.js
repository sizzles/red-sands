/**
 * BROKEN ROAD — HOSTILITY
 * ============================================================================
 * Witnesses, escalation and pursuit at the survivor camps. Owned and stepped by
 * Player; drawn (the marks) by HUD. Nothing in here touches the renderer.
 *
 * This was the western's LAW system and the mechanic is unchanged, because the
 * mechanic was never really about law: it is about being SEEN doing something,
 * and a camp of armed survivors deciding you are a problem works exactly the
 * same way a sheriff did. What changed is who is coming — there is no law left
 * to call, only the people whose gate you just shot somebody in front of, which
 * is why nothing here escalates beyond the district it happened in.
 *
 *   WHY IT LIVES HERE.  Killing a townsperson is not a rendering event and it
 *   is not a physics event — it is a *social* one, and the only thing that
 *   makes it read as a crime rather than as a ragdoll is that somebody SAW it.
 *   So the model is built round the witness, not round the corpse:
 *
 *     1. the shot lands                     → the victim goes down
 *     2. anyone with eyes on it reacts      → they freeze, then bolt
 *     3. a beat passes (GRACE seconds)      → only NOW does it become a crime
 *     4. the wanted level ticks up, a bounty accrues, and at two stars the
 *        law is roused and comes for you
 *     5. break line of sight and clear the district and it bleeds away again
 *
 *   Step 3 is the whole feel of it. Without the beat the stars appear on the
 *   same frame as the muzzle flash and the player never connects the two; with
 *   it, there is a moment of "did anyone see that" before the consequence
 *   lands, which is exactly the moment the request was asking for.
 *
 *   ANIMALS ARE NOT PEOPLE.  There is no path in this file from Wildlife to a
 *   wanted level — the only entry point that can raise one is `applyHit()` on a
 *   FOLK agent. Shooting every deer in the territory can never light a star.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BROAD PHASE — this runs every frame in a 16.7 ms budget with no headroom.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The town's population is a single instanced mesh a long way from most of the
 * map, so the whole system is behind ONE sphere test against a cached town
 * centre: outside `_farCull` metres, `update()` does a distance compare and
 * returns, and that is the entire cost for nine of the ten capture shots. In
 * range, the witness sweep is amortised at 8 Hz over ≤ 40 agents using squared
 * distances against positions that Folk has ALREADY written into its instance
 * matrix this frame — no transforms are recomputed, nothing is allocated, and
 * the per-agent inner loop is six multiplies.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INTERFACING WITH THE FOLK
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `Town`/`Folk` are not ours to edit. If the world side publishes a hit API we
 * use it (see `_folkApi()` — every plausible spelling is probed once and
 * cached); otherwise we drive the agents through their own public data, which
 * Folk.update() reads every frame anyway:
 *
 *   a.path = null + a.x/a.y/a.z   detach an agent from its baked path so we own
 *                                 its position, facing and gait outright
 *   a.tilt                        pitch about the feet — this is what lays a
 *                                 body out on the ground
 *   a.gait / a.gaitArr            walk-cycle rate, per instance
 *
 * Nothing here writes to a file it does not own.
