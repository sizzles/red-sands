/**
 * RED SANDS — PLAYER
 * ============================================================================
 * A 1.80 m procedural gunslinger with a full procedural locomotion system.
 *
 *   CONTROL      WASD + mouse look, shift sprint, space jump, ctrl crouch.
 *                Movement runs on the physics fixed step (1/60) and the
 *                render pose interpolates, so nothing judders.
 *   LOCOMOTION   idle / walk / jog / sprint blended on speed01, with real
 *                contralateral arm swing, pelvis counter-rotation against the
 *                shoulders, spine lean into acceleration, and head
 *                stabilisation so the eyeline stays level through the bob.
 *   FOOT PLANT   the stride is derived from the actual ground speed so the
 *                stance foot is world-static (no skating), and both ankles are
 *                two-bone-IK'd onto ctx.world.getHeight, so on a slope the
 *                downhill leg extends and the pelvis rolls to match.
 *   CLOTH        three coat-skirt bones and the hat carry spring-damper
 *                secondary motion driven by acceleration, stride and
 *                env.windVector.
 *   CONTACT      a multiply-blended terrain-conforming AO patch under the feet
 *                in addition to the CSM cast shadow. Without it the figure
 *                floats and destroys the very sense of scale it is there for.

   * both arms leave the rifle for world sockets on the carcass, the right one

     * which put the butt plate 18 cm BEHIND the chest bone — hanging by his
     * neck instead of in the shoulder pocket — and drove the support arm
     * through his own ribs (left forearm 46 mm from the spine axis at aim-down,
     * against 127 mm on foot).
     *
     * The coefficients are exactly the on-foot ones, so the shoulder pocket
     * lands in the same place in chest-local space and the arm IK reaches the
     * sockets the same way it already does standing. Nothing here moves at
     * blade = 0, so the approved riding pose is untouched.
     *
     * The one addition the saddle needs of its own: a rider cannot pivot his
     * feet, so when the aim swings off the horse's ears he twists at the waist
     * instead. `af` opens the existing aim-follow chain up while the sights are
