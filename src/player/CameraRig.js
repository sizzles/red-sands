/**
 * RED SANDS — CAMERA RIG
 * ============================================================================
 * RDR2-style third person.
 *
 *   SPRING ARM   pivot at the character's shoulder height, arm behind and to
 *                the right, critically-damped follow on both the pivot and the
 *                orbit so the camera lags the character without wobbling.
 *   LOOK-AHEAD   the aim point leads the direction of travel, scaled by speed,
 *                so at a gallop you are looking where you are going.
 *   SPEED FEEL   the arm lengthens and the FOV widens with speed01, and both
 *                ease back in when you slow down.
 *   COLLISION    the arm is sphere-cast against terrain and registered bodies
 *                through Physics; blocked distance is pulled in fast and let
 *                back out slowly so it never pops.
 *   LIFE         low-amplitude handheld noise plus a gait-coupled bob, and a
 *                shake() impulse channel wired to PostFX.
 *
 *   setFreeCamera(pos, look, fov) is the screenshot harness contract: it
 *   completely overrides follow so captures are deterministic.

     * That NaN reached _bob, then _pos, then camera.position — and a camera at
     * a non-finite position projects nothing AND makes every local light score
     * NaN, sort last and fall outside the budget. On screen it is a total
     * freeze, one second into pressing E, with no error in the console.
     *
     * The bike now has a phase. The guard stays anyway: this is a silent,
     * total, unrecoverable failure and it costs one isFinite to refuse.
