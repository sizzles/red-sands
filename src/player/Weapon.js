/**
 * RED SANDS — LEVER-ACTION RIFLE
 * ============================================================================
 * A ~1.00 m carbine built out of merged primitives at boot (three draw calls:
 * wood, steel, and the lever, which has to rotate on its own). It is NOT
 * parented to a hand bone — the hands are posed onto IT.
 *
 *   WHY THAT WAY ROUND.  A rifle hung off the right hand can never be
 *   shouldered correctly: the butt, the cheek weld and the sight line are all
 *   defined relative to the shooter's EYE, not to his wrist. So the weapon
 *   solves its own world transform first and publishes two GRIP SOCKETS —
 *   `handR` at the wrist of the stock, `handL` on the fore-end — each carrying
 *   a palm point, a hand direction and an elbow pole, all defined in the
 *   carbine's own frame. Player two-bone-IKs an arm onto each. Both hands then
 *   land where they physically have to, on foot and in the saddle, at any
 *   pitch, at any blend weight, because the sockets are properties of the
 *   WEAPON and cannot go stale when the pose changes.
 *
 *   ANCHORS.  The aimed pose hangs off the aiming EYE (the head bone, live, so
 *   the cheek stays on the comb through the gait bob). Slung and low ready
 *   hang off the CHEST bone, so the carbine rides the spine lean, the shoulder
 *   counter-rotation and the saddle without a single special case. Player
 *   writes all three every frame through setAnchors().
 *
 *   CARRY        slung muzzle-up behind the right shoulder when it is not in
 *                use, brought down to a low ready when it is, shouldered on
 *                right mouse. Three poses, blended by two scalars.
 *   SWAY         the aim ray carries a two-frequency breathing sway. Holding
 *                the steady-breath key collapses it to a fifth for as long as
 *                the breath lasts, and when it runs out the sway comes back
 *                worse than it started for a couple of seconds.
 *   FIRE         hitscan from the muzzle along the (swayed) aim ray with a
 *                spread cone, a spring recoil impulse on the weapon and a
 *                separate one on the camera, muzzle flash + smoke through
 *                Particles, and a `gunshot` event that Audio, Particles AND
 *                every animal in earshot are already listening for.
 *   CYCLE        the lever throws open and closed over ~0.45 s; you cannot
 *                fire during it, and the sights dip while it happens.
 *
 * Owned and driven by Player — it is not a registered system.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- GRIP SOCKETS
 *
 * THE HANDS ARE A PROPERTY OF THE WEAPON, NOT OF THE POSE.
 *
 * Each socket is three vectors in the carbine's own local frame:
 *
 *   palm  where the CENTRE OF THE HAND MESH has to end up. Note that the arm
 *         IK solves the WRIST, and the hand blob hangs PALM_DROP below the
 *         wrist joint — solving the wrist onto the wood is what put the stock
 *         through the middle of the character's fist in the last pass.
 *   dir   wrist -> fingertips, i.e. which way the hand lies along the weapon.
 *   pole  where the elbow is thrown. Because it is expressed in the WEAPON's
 *         frame it rotates with the gun, so the firing elbow rides high behind
 *         a shouldered rifle and drops as the carbine comes down to a low
 *         ready, without a single pose-specific special case.
 *
 * The trigger socket is at the wrist of the stock (hand behind the lever, on
 * the drop); the support socket is on the WOOD of the fore-end, 7 cm behind the
 * barrel band. That last number is load-bearing: at the band the support hand
 * was 0.54 m from the shoulder joint against a 0.566 m arm, so the left arm was
 * locked bolt straight and, once PALM_DROP was accounted for, could not reach
 * at all — which is exactly the "support hand is not on the fore-end" the
 * playtester saw. Pulled back to 0.246 the arm sits at 79 % extension with a
 * proper bend in it.

 * -------------------------------------------------------------- CARRY ANCHORS
 * Both carry poses are expressed in the CHEST BONE's frame, not in the
 * character's root frame. The root is the point on the ground between the
 * boots: hung off that, the carbine ignored the spine lean, the shoulder
 * counter-rotation and the whole gait bob, and read as floating half a step
 * behind the man. Anchored on the chest it is welded to the torso for free.
 *
 * SLUNG is specified as a muzzle POINT plus a bore direction plus a roll,
 * because the two things that have to be true — the barrel clears the hat brim
 * (0.238 m radius, crown at chest+0.39) and the butt clears the coat back — are
 * both statements about where the ends of the weapon are, not about Euler
 * angles. Cant the receiver over so its top faces outboard: the 0.12 m drop at
