 * ============================================================================
 *  WEATHER — an evolving climate simulation.

 *     env.ambientColor / ambientIntensity / turbidity
 *     env.fogColor / fogDensity / groundMist
 *     env.cloudCover / cloudDensity
 *     env.wetness / rainIntensity / snowIntensity / snowCover
 *     env.lightningFlash / weatherName
 *     env.windVector / windStrength / windGust
 *
 *  Additive public surface (documented in the report, safe to read):
 *     env.cloudType        0 = flat stratus … 0.5 = cumulus … 1 = cumulonimbus
 *     env.cirrus           0..1 high wispy cirrus deck amount
 *     env.sunAttenuation   0..1 how much the cloud deck should kill the sun
 *     env.puddleLevel      0..1 standing water (fills slower, dries slower)
 *     env.temperature      degrees C, drives snow / melt
 *     env.thunder          0..1 storm severity, for audio beds
 *     env.windPhase        metres the gust front has travelled downwind.
 *                          ONE coherent wind for the whole world: any system
 *                          can reconstruct the *same* travelling gust with
 *                             g = gustWave(dot(pos.xz, windDirXZ) - windPhase)
 *                          or just call weather.gustAt(x, z) → 0..1. Grass,
 *                          trees, dust, cloth, water chop and the particle
 *                          system all read this so a gust is visibly one event
 *                          crossing the landscape rather than every object
 *                          wobbling on its own clock.
 *     env.windWaveLength   metres between gust crests
 *     env.windTurb         0..1 small-scale turbulence amount
 *
 *  Design notes
 *  ------------
 *  * The state machine is Markov-ish with *plausible* edges only: `clear` can
 *    never jump to `storm`; it has to walk clear → fair → overcast → rain →
 *    storm. Dwell times are minutes, not seconds.
 *  * NOTHING steps. Every scalar is pushed through a first-order low pass with
 *    a per-field time constant, so a state switch is a slow front rolling in.
 *  * Rain leaves the world wet for a long time afterwards, puddles fill and
 *    evaporate on a slower clock again, and snow accumulates then melts. Those
 *    persistent after-effects are the thing that sells weather as a simulation.

   * DRIZZLE — and this is the one that defines the game.
   *
   * The Pacific Northwest's characteristic weather is not the thunderstorm; it
   * is a low, featureless stratus deck sitting on the ridges, dropping water so
   * fine it barely registers as falling, for eleven hours at a stretch. It is
   * NOT a weak version of `rain` — the numbers pull in different directions:
   *
   *   cloudCover .96 / cloudType .04   a lid, not cells. There is no structure
   *                                    overhead to be silhouetted against,
   *                                    which is what makes the light so flat.
   *   rain 0.16                        barely any falling water...
   *   groundMist 0.55, fog 0.0011      ...but very poor visibility anyway,
   *                                    because the cloud base is ON the
   *                                    terrain. That inversion — low rain, high
   *                                    mist — is the whole signature, and it is
   *                                    exactly the opposite of the storm
   *                                    profile above, where heavy rain
   *                                    SCAVENGES the fog out of the air.
   *   wind 2.2                         and it is dead still, which is why
   *                                    drizzle feels so much heavier than the
   *                                    rainfall figure suggests.
   *
   * The long dwell (up to 22 minutes) is deliberate: it should feel like it is
   * never going to stop, because that is the point.
