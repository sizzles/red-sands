 * STANDS — the mosaic a forest is actually made of.
 *
 * Clumping and height variance were already here and already working: the
 * density map opens and closes at 640 m and 185 m, sizes come off a log-normal
 * with a 5.5% emergent tail, and the rim runts. What was missing is the thing
 * that reads from a ridge a kilometre away, which is that a forest is a patchwork
 * of COHORTS. A stand regenerates from a single event — a fire, a blowdown, a
 * cut — so its trees came up in the same decade and are mostly the same species.
 * The visible consequence is a hillside laid out in blocks: even-aged pine, then
 * oak, then a young patch standing half the height of everything around it.
 *
 * Drawing species and size independently per tree gives none of that. It gives
 * salt-and-pepper mixing at every scale and one flat canopy plane, which is what
 * the wide forest shot showed — texture, but no structure above the tree.
 *
 * Two very cheap fields fix it, sampled per tree rather than stored:
 *
 *   standSpecies  biases the two- and three-way species splits, so a stand has a
 *                 dominant with a minority admixture instead of a 50/50 spray
 *   standAge      scales the whole cohort's height, and gates the emergents,
 *                 because a 25-year regen patch has no giants in it yet
 *
 * Both are smooth trig rather than cellular, deliberately: real stand boundaries
 * interfinger over tens of metres, and a Voronoi cell would put a straight edge
 * across the hillside. ~165 m fundamental with a ~70 m second octave to break it.

 * FOREST
 * ============================================================================
 * Placement, three-level LOD and the impostor band.
 *
 *   LOD0  full geometry              0 .. A
 *   LOD1  reduced branch/card count  A .. B
 *   LOD2  baked billboard impostor   B .. treeDistance      (one draw call)
 *
 * THE LOD BANDS ARE EXCLUSIVE AND THERE IS NO CROSS-FADE. Pass 2 kept a tree in
 * two levels at once through a wide band and resolved it with a complementary
 * screen-space dither, on the assumption TAA would turn the checkerboard into a
 * blend. There is no TAA and the framebuffer is not multisampled, so the dither
 * survived to the final image and PostFX's chromatic aberration smeared it into
 * colour — the forensic pass logged it as "interleaved horizontal stripes of two
 * LODs plus chromatic fringing, a rainbow smear" at (590,620) in
 * golden_hour_vista and (75,520) in high_noon_desert.
 *
 * What replaces it is structural rather than cosmetic:
 *   - both mesh LODs are emitted from ONE grown skeleton (see TreeGen), so the
 *     trunk silhouette is identical across the swap and the canopy outline moves
 *     by a card or two;
 *   - the impostor inherits the mesh's per-card colour jitter at bake time, so
 *     there is no tint step into the billboard band;
 *   - every tree carries a stable +/-15% jitter on its own switch distances, so
 *     a stand does not change level along a visible circle. That also kills the
 *     "visible LOD band ... conifers abruptly give way to flat smudges" finding.
 * The CPU and the impostor vertex shader test the same quantity (distance from
 * the camera to the tree's base) against the same jittered thresholds, so a tree
 * is in exactly one level with no seam and no double-draw.
 *
 * Only LOD0/LOD1 need CPU work, and only when the camera has actually moved:
 * trees are bucketed into a 64 m grid at boot, and the visible set is re-packed
 * into per-kind instance buffers. The impostor mesh holds every tree in the
 * world for its whole life and culls itself in the vertex shader.
