/**
 * Town — the mill town, and the camp. Emptied, not destroyed.
 *
 * PASS-1 FINDING (critical, town_street): "There is no town. […] Not one
 * building, fence, water trough, boardwalk or wagon." This file is the answer.
 *
 * How it is put together
 * ----------------------
 *  1. `Street` lofts a bending spine across the flattest shelf Terrain could
 *     find and derives a GRADE — a morphological closing of the cross-section
 *     maxima. Terrain owns that grade now (town/Pad.js) and publishes it
 *     through `ctx.world.getHeight`, so the pad is always fill — a graded shelf
 *     with a shallow embankment at the rim — and the query agrees with it.
 *  2. `Ground` lays the crowned, wheel-rutted street on that grade and the two
 *     boardwalks, plank by plank, with gaps, sag, value jitter and missing
 *     boards.
 *  3. `Layout` allocates sixteen lots and picks a type for each. Buildings are
 *     parameterised masses (`Buildings.js`) built around FALSE FRONTS: a thick
 *     screen wall with a stepped cap and a projecting cornice, hiding a smaller
 *     shed or gable behind it. Two specials carry the skyline — a church with a
 *     nine-metre tower and an eight-sided spire, and gambrel-roofed barns.
 *  4. `Props` supplies everything vertical that the pass-1 critique asked for:
 *     telegraph poles with catenary wire, a lattice water tower, a windmill
 *     whose rotor actually turns, hitching rails, troughs, fences, a buckboard.
 *  5. `Wear` runs a per-pixel weathering pass over every surface — per-board
 *     value jitter, sun bleaching on up- and south-facing planes, rain and rust
 *     streaks under the eaves, dirt splash to knee height, dust on horizontals.
 *     Nothing is pristine and nothing tiles visibly.
 *
 * Everything static is merged into ONE indexed geometry per material, so the
 * whole settlement is ~17 draw calls; the camp is a second, tightly-bounded
 * set of ~6 so its bounding sphere does not drag the town into every shadow
 * cascade.
 *
 * Deterministic: every random number comes from rng(ctx.seed).

   * THE LAW LOOKS FOR THESE NAMES, NOT THE ONES ABOVE.
   *
   * `Wanted._folkApi()` probes for an NPC hit API by name and defers to it if
   * it finds one, otherwise it drives the agents itself. It probes
   * `raycastNpc` / `applyNpcHit` — camel case — and the names published above
   * are `raycastNPC` / `applyNPCHit`. JavaScript is case sensitive, so the
   * probe missed by one letter and the whole Folk death path was unreachable:
   * measured, a killed townsman kept `a.dead === 0`, which meant
   *
   *   · `Folk.alarm()` and `Folk._think()` (both guarded on `a.dead`) went on
   *     treating the corpse as a bystander — the next shot handed it a flee
   *     path and it RAN 10.5 m down the street lying flat on its back;
   *   · its collider stayed a solid, upright 1.75 m capsule instead of the
   *     0.386 m CORPSE-masked one `_think` installs as the body folds;
   *   · the 200 s corpse TTL, the sink and the despawn never ran, so bodies
   *     were permanent;
   *   · and `ctx.emit('npcKilled')` never fired for anyone downstream.
   *
   * Aliasing here rather than renaming the contract keeps both spellings live
   * for anything already calling the published one. Two adjustments are made
   * on the way through:
   *   `species` — Weapon's kill notification and `lastShot` read it, and Folk
   *               does not deal in species.
   *   `rsDead`  — Wanted's own bookkeeping flag. It guards nine places
   *               (witness counting, deputising, its raycast), all of which
   *               must keep seeing a body as a body now that Folk, not
   *               Wanted, is the one killing people.
